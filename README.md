# Roman Fisherman VR Experience

Part of a university module titled Mixed Reality. This is a Human-Computer Interaction / user experience report of a prototype of a VR mini-game. Design decisions and reflection based on academic Human-Computer Interaction research.

The player experiences sensory misalignment, simulating the feeling of being on a boat. The player will feel like their body is toppling over when they move or lean towards the edge of the boat.

The brief was to create a mixed reality experience to engage visitors at a specific museum or site of historic interest. The core idea is to use mixed reality to combine digital content with some form of physical experience. 

This is a prototype of a VR spearfishing mini-game that would be the core part of a tourist experience (if it was real) at the British museum for the Ancient Rome section.
